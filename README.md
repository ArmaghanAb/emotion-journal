## üí° Project Motivation

Mental health is one of the most critical yet underserved areas, especially for people who need immediate, private emotional support.

The idea behind **Emotion Journal** is to create a personal space where users can:
- Express their feelings freely.
- Get supportive AI feedback.
- Monitor their emotional trends over time.
- Feel heard and understood even outside professional therapy.

By combining conversational AI with real-time analytics, Emotion Journal encourages mindfulness, reflection, and positive growth.
